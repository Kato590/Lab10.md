Challenge 1 - Steganography
Kenny.png looks like a humming by Kenny. It is located at the bottom or somewhere else in a picture file when opened as a text file. After that, open Kenny Translator (https://www.namesuppressed.com/kenny/) and put the humming in it and translate it. Then, you can see the secret message. 

Challenge 2 - A SE Anecdote

There are many reasons why this happened, partialyl due to his security awareness and partially because the customer services at GoDaddy and PayPal did not have good policies on the authentication. He was not using the two factor authentication on any web services, and PayPal service reprentative let the attacker know the last four digits of his credit card number over the phone.
